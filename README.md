# Automatic Hand Sanitizer
#An automatic hand sanitizer using IoT (Internet of Things) is a device that dispenses hand sanitizer in a contactless and automated manner, and is connected to the internet for remote monitoring and control.

The device is typically equipped with sensors that detect the presence of a person's hand and trigger the dispenser to release an appropriate amount of hand sanitizer. The IoT connectivity allows the device to be remotely monitored and controlled, and provides real-time data on usage patterns and sanitizer levels, allowing for efficient management of the device.

The automatic hand sanitizer may also be integrated with other IoT devices, such as temperature sensors and occupancy detectors, to provide additional data on hygiene conditions in a given environment. The device may also include features such as facial recognition or QR code scanning to allow for contact tracing and tracking of usage.
